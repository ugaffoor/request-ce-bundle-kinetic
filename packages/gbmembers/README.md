# Queue (request-ce-bundle-queue)
The Queue Kapp is a work management system build on Kinetic Request CE. Work items can be tasks, approvals, cases or any combination that make up a fulfillment process. Queue helps organize your todo's into lists of work to be completed, and allows you to spawn off ad-hoc work items, and invite others to work on an item with you.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) - A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) - A package manager for your code
* [Kinetic Request CE](https://community.kineticdata.com/Kinetic_Request/Kinetic_Request_Core_Edition/Releases) - The Kinetic Request CE Application
* [request-ce-bundle-webpack](https://github.com/KineticCommunity/request-ce-bundle-webpack) - The Webpack bundle used for serving React Projects on Kinetic Request CE.

### Installing
1. Create a Kapp in your space (Typically called "Queue")
2. Within the Kapp Settings
  - Set the "Bundle Path" to the location of your webpack bundle (ex. webpack)
  - Set the "Kapp Display Page" to "webpack.jsp?bundleName=request-ce-bundle-kinops-queue"
3. CD into this project and type `yarn install --ignore-engines`
4. Next type in `yarn start` to start the development web server.
5. You will be prompted to enter in your Kinetic Web server address and a name for the project
6. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/<YOUR_SPACE_SLUG>/<YOUR_KAPP_SLUG>
7. If this is the first time running the Queue Kapp, a setup wizard will walk you through the rest!

## Kapp Configuration References
The Queue Application leverages different type of Kinetic Request CE configurations for driving logic within the App. These configurations have been outlined below.

### Form Fields Reference

### Form Type Reference
Form Types are used to group forms within Kinetic Request CE. The following Form Types have been defined within the Queue app.
1. Automated -- Automated Forms are forms that are created via workflow (Kinetic Task Processes). These forms do not show up when clicking the "Create New Task" button, or when creating a new sub-task as they are designed to be created via workflow.
2. Task -- Forms of type `Task` will show up when creating a new Task from within the Queue App. These forms are also able to be subtasks.
3. Subtask -- Forms of type `Subtask` will only show up when creating a Subtask from a parent Task.
4. Template -- Forms of type `Template` are used for creating new Tasks within the Queue System, and are configured with all required fields.
* All Tasks are Subtasks, but Subtasks are not Tasks


### Attribute Reference
Attributes in Kinetic Request CE are like variables that can be tied to any object within the application. For example, a Kapp can have an attribute called "Icon" which dictates what Icon should display when referencing the Kapp within the User Interface. Below is a listing of all attributes and what they control within the Queue Kapp.

Certain attributes (noted below with `**`) have been defined at the Space, Kapp and Form levels. This means, that if the attribute exists at the `Form` level, it will override the attribute value set at the `Kapp` level...etc. The Space is the "highest" level, and then "Kapp" then "Form".

#### Kapp Attributes
Attribute Name | Description     | Example
-------------- | --------------  | --------------
Icon           | The [Font Awesome Icons](http://fontawesome.io/icons/) Font Awesome icon used to represent this kapp. | `fa-list-ul`
Description    | A short description of what this kapp is used for, typically displayed on the Kapp Listing (home) Page | `When you have work to do, youâ€™ll see it here. Queue helps teams get work done in a snap.`
Owning Team   | The Owning Team attribute is used to control who has access to administer the kapp. Users that are a part of the team set here can create new forms, and update the Kapp's settings. | `Queue Admins`
_**Notification Template Name - Create_ | The Name of the Notification Template to use when a Task in Queue is been created | `Task Created`
_**Notification Template Name - Complete_ | The Name of the Notification Template to use when a Task in Queue is been submitted | `Task Completed`

#### Form Attributes
Attribute Name | Description     | Example
-------------- | --------------  | --------------
Icon           | The [Font Awesome Icons](http://fontawesome.io/icons/) Font Awesome icon used to represent this Form within the app. | `fa-tasks`
Assignment Type | Dictates if the App should present an assignment selector before displaying a form. If not set on a given form, the App will present a Assignment Selector before displaying the form when creating the Task. If set to `None` the form builder will need to display the `Assigned Team` / `Assigned Individual` fields or default them. | `None`
Discussion Id | The Id of the Discussion related to this form. Typically where form owners can collaborate on form changes. | `<discussion guid>`
Owning Team   | Dictates who can create a new task using this form from within the app. If left blank, anyone with access to the Queue App can create new tasks using this form.  | `Human Resources`
Permitted Subtasks | Dictates which subtasks are allowed to be created / related to tasks that use this form. If left blank, any sub-tasks can be added to tasks created with this form. This attribute allows multiple values which should be the `Form Slug` of the desired sub-task | `adhoc-approval`
Prohibit Subtasks | Setting this value to `True` will not allow a user to create sub-tasks on a task created using this form. | `True`
_**Notification Template Name - Create_ | The Name of the Notification Template to use when a Task for this form is created | `Task Created`
_**Notification Template Name - Complete_ | The Name of the Notification Template to use when a Task for this form is submitted | `Task Completed - Ad-hoc Task`


## Yarn Command Reference
* `yarn start` will run the project in development mode (requires Kinetic
  Request CE to be running)
* `yarn run build` will build the project in "production" mode (this will create
  a *dist* directory with all of the static files necessary to deploy the
  project)
* `yarn add LIBRARY` will install a library and update the *package.json* file.
* `yarn test` will run all of the test cases one time.
* `yarn test:watch` will run test cases each time changes are detected in the source files.

## Building the App for Production
In order to expose the project to others, the static files will need to be
accessible (Amazon s3 is often a convenient and simple way to serve the files).

One the static files have been deployed somewhere, the space or kapp display
page can be set to **webpack.jsp?bundleName=BUNDLE_NAME&location=LOCATION**
(where **BUNDLE_NAME** is equal to the 'X-Webpack-Bundle-Name' specified in the `/package.json` file
and **LOCATION** is equal to the location that the files are served from, such
as *https://s3.amazonaws.com/acme.com/bundles/queue*.).
